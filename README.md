# SemEval 2024 Task 1: Textual Semantic Relatedness

Welcome to the official repository for the SemEval Shared Task on Textual Semantic Relatedness!

The Semantic Textual Relatedness is the task of predicting semantic textual relatedness (STR) of sentence pairs. Participants will rank sentence pairs by their closeness in meaning (i.e., their degree of semantic relatedness) in 14 languages predominantly from Africa and Asia. All sentence pairs will have manually determined relatedness scores between 0 (completely unrelated) and 1 (maximally related).
